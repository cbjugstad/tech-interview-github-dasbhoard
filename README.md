#Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a user dashboard that can retrieve Github events via the Github API. This project is written using web components and Polymer, using the Polymer Starter Kit as a launching point.

##Setup and prerequisites
Assuming Node is installed, you can run this one liner from your project root directory to perform the necessary setup:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

##How to run
Once gulp is installed, the development workflow to run this project is also just a one line command:

```sh
gulp serve
```

Once that process finishes, you'll have two ways to access the site. The first is a local IP address and port number, and the second is an IP address that other devices can access as long as they are on the same network.

##Additional information
Inline comments have been placed to help illustrate what's happening in the code, but here's a general overview:

A demo version of this application is also hosted on Firebase and can be located [here](https://resplendent-inferno-8422.firebaseapp.com). 

A standard webflow is included to allow OAuth authentication through your Github account. Clicking the login button will launch a new tab prompting you for your Github credentials (if you're not already signed in). Once logged in, you should get redirected back to the site. 

#####Index.html
The index.html file in the app folder (dist folder for the compiled code) is the main entry point into the code. This code has the standard HTML header info and then is followed by the main UI layout, which is mostly wrapped up in the git-view element. The git-view has a paper-drawer-panel with the main content changing based on page.js routing to different sections in this file. Example below:

```sh
<iron-pages attr-for-selected="data-route" selected="{{route}}">

  <section data-route="home">
    <git-selection></git-selection>
  </section>

  <section data-route="events">
    <git-event-search username="{{username}}" page="{{page}}"></git-event-search>
    <git-events username="{{username}}" page="{{page}}"></git-events>
  </section>
  
  ...
  
</iron-pages>
```

#####Routing and Navigation
The app/elements/routing.html contains the routing information. Different anchors in the code cause different sections in the main index.html file to be displayed. The following portion of the routing.html file would render the section in the example above:

```sh
page('/events', function(data) {
  app.route = 'events';
});
```

The git-selection element has links to send you to the events or issues pages, and the sections for those are located in the same area as the git-selection element on the git-view page. Right now, there are a number of similarities in the code between the structure of the events and issues elements so my hope is to eventually wrap those up into a single element to reduce the duplication. I'm creating issues in my repo to track enhancements like this.

#####Event refreshing
Basic search fields are in place for the events and issues sections, and clicking the search button calls the API and updates results  on click. Also, for the events page, once the element is ready on the page, it kicks off a process that auto-refreshes the events once a minute. The frequency choice was based on the rate limits Github has in place.

#####Testing Components
The web-component-tester utility is really useful for writing unit tests against the custom elements that are created. To set it up, run the following command: 

```sh
npm install -g web-component-tester
```

Basic test components have been set up for each custom element in this project, and the long-term goal is definitely to include more testing here. To run the test, run the following from the root of your project:

```sh
wct
```

###Future plans
As I discover bugs or have feature ideas, I'll be posting them as issues in my Github repo. Feel free to browse that area to see some of the thoughts I've had so far.


###Final note
There's definitely a large code base here, but ultimately the goal is to end up with readable HTML using some of the powerful tools the Polymer library has as a starting point to build new HTML primitives. I'm hoping this readme can help to point to where the real work is happening to minimize any potential confusion. 

Happy reviewing!

#Technical Interview Homework: GitHub Dashboard

##Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to assess the candidateâ€™s ability to build cross platform software clients that satisfy stated requirements. The completed assignment should not only satisfy the requirements outlined below, but also give the candidate an opportunity to show-off their skills.

##Prerequisites
- Candidates must have a GitHub account

##Instructions
1. Fork this repository - [https://github.com/cbjugstad/tech-interview-github-dashboard](https://github.com/cbjugstad/tech-interview-github-dashboard)
2. Create a client that satisfies the requirements below
3. Include, at the top of this README, instructions required for the reviewer to run the submission
4. Include, at the top of this README, any other information that will be useful to the reviewer
5. Create a pull request prior to the due date to have your submission reviewed

Once the submission is reviewed the candidate will be notified and possibly invited to participate in a follow-up interview where interviewers will collaboratively work with the candidate to review the submission, discuss possible enhancements, and possibly implement a new feature. 

#####Additional Notes...

- Feel free to ask your point of contact any clarifying questions you might have. 
- Submissions must be relatively trivial to run as outlined in the candidate's instructions. We suggest that you test the run instructions on a clean clone of your repository. **Submissions we can't run per the instructions will be rejected.**
- Client technology for the submission is at the discretion of the candidate, Preferred platforms include the following...
	- **Xamarin** - Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio
	- **HTML/CSS/JS (touch friendly, tablet/phone targeted)**
	- **Native iOS** - Xcode 
	- **Native Android** - Android Studio
	- **Windows/Phone** - Visual Studio
- Third party libraries or packages are acceptable but must be managed via a package manager i.e. Nuget, CocoaPods, npm, bower, etc. Third party components will NOT be manually installed by the reviewer.


##Assessment

Cross platform client development requires a familiarity and aptitude to work with...

- Client platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, Web Browsers, etc.
- Presentation layer frameworks: Native iOS & Android, Cordova, HTML/CSS/JS, etc.
- HTTP based APIs

#####Assessment will focus on the candidate's ability to...

- Review and understand API documentation.
- Consume an API, and present API content in a client. 
- Write clear, understandable, and maintainable code. Please use the predominant coding style for whatever language the submission is written in.
- Create a simple and understandable user interface and user experience. Note that clear and understandable does NOT mean graphically interesting.
- The user experience should be targeted at a mobile screen size, preferably tablet optimized yet functional on a phone sized screen.

#####Exceptional Candidates will...

- Submit a solution that will run on both iOS and Android
